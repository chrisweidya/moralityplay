1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,870
I know.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,820
Listen, I gotta go.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,290
It's actually almost time for my interview.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,640
Good luck.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,410
Tell me how it goes?

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,720
Sure.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,430
Thanks again. Bye.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,020
What was that?

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,840
I mean. I was trying to help.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,980
I didn't just magically get here because I am black.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,400
I am a straight A student.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,370
Top of my class.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,070
I know I belong here.

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,560
At least that's what I tell myself everyday

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,410
that I'm just as good as anybody else.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,740
that I earn my spot by working hard.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,110
When someone says something like that,

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,740
it makes you question yourself.

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,790
Like, am I really good enough to be here?

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,010
Or did they have a open slot they had to fill with someone like me.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,070
I wonder why she thought saying that,

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,410
would help.
