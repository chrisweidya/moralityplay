1
00:00:02,980 --> 0:00:05,710
I guess we can just move on. 

2
0:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,496
Don't worry about it. 
We've got it this time.

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,453
Back home, there was not a problem 
that I could not handle.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,064
Everybody used to say that I'm smart.

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,400
But here it is a daily struggle just to be heard. 

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,108
I know my English is not so good.

7
00:00:31,230 -->  00:00:35,541
But that doesn't mean that 
my opinions and ideas matter less. 

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,960
I wish they would just ask, 
what do you mean, if they don't understand,

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,568
but they don't. It's easier for them to ignore

10
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:45,568
to move on.

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Without me.

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,248
I have so much to contribute. 
If only they would make an effort to listen.
