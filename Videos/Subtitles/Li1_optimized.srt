1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,970
I will check it and let you know.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,830
Thank you!

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,440
You are welcome!

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,480
Hi!

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,240
Don't worry about it. 
We are just geting started.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,140
We don't have a lot of time.
So let's cut to the chase.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,090
What does that mean?

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,200
Ah. Don't worry about it.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,220
Let's start.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,220
I sumed up all the key points 
for our presentation.

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,340
Here you go.

12
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,080
Whoa! This is awsome. 
Thank you for doing this.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,360
No problem.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,230
I figure it could help speed things up.

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,570
Let me know if you have questions.

16
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,540
Um. Where is the part that I wrote?

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,350
Did you receive my e-mail.

18
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,690
I did,and it was really good. 

19
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,750
You did a great job.

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,450
But..It was just some of the phrasing.

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,390
I didn't really have time to rewrite it.

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,530
Don't worry 
we covered some of your points else where.

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,850
But we all refer to your research here.

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,360
What do you think?

25
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,950
Never mind. Let's move on.

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,870
All right.

27
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,780
I was also thinking of a way 
to share the presentation between us.

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,890
So you can do the introductions.

29
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,650
You can talk about the research and hypothesis. 
OK

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,220
You can talk about the procedure,

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,680
and I will present the result and conclusion.

32
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,930
Sound good with everyone?

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,530
Um, what's my role?

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,740
Um, the introduction. 
It's pretty simple.

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,030
Can I say more?

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Well. It's not that long 
of a presentation.

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,360
Um. Hey what if you also introduce 
the main topics.

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,450
I was hoping to do more than just introduce.

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,420
Including the topic intros. 
I think it will be fine.

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,320
and we can help you with the wording.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
