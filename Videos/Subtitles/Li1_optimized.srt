1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,970
I will check it and let you know.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,830
Thank you!

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,440
You are welcome!

4
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,480
Hi!

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,240
Don't worry about it. 
We are just geting started.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,140
We don't have a lot of time.
So let's cut to the chase.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,090
What does that mean?

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,200
Ah. Don't worry about it.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,220
Let's start.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,220
I sumed up all the key points 
for our presentation.

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,080
Whoa! This is awsome. 
Thank you for doing this.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,360
No problem.

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,230
I think it will help speed things up.

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,570
Let me know if you have questions.

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,250
Um. Where is the part that I wrote? 
Did you receive my e-mail.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,010
I did,and it was really good. You did a great job.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,520
It was just some of the phrasing.
I didn't really have time to rewrite it.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,530
Don't worry we covered some of your points else where.

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,850
But we all refer to your research here.

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,360
What do you think?

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,950
Never mind. Let's move on.

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,260
All right./nI'm also thinking of a way to share the presentation between us.

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,890
So you can do the introductions.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,650
You can talk about the research and hypothesis. 
OK

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,890
You can talk about the procedure, 
and I will present the result and conclusion.

26
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,930
Sound good with everyone?

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,530
Um, what's my role?

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,740
Um, the introduction. It's pretty simple.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,030
Can I say more?

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Well. It's not that long of a presentation.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,360
Um. Hey what about you also introduce the main topics.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,450
I was hoping to do more than just introduce.

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,480
Including the topic intros. I think it will be fine,
and we can help you with the wordings.
