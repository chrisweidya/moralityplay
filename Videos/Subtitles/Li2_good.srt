1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,512
I thought it'll be easier for you that way.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,192
I think I can handle more. I want to.

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,890
Oh, okay. You know what,
I'll take another look at it.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay. Thanks.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,500
Back home there was not a problem
that I could not handle. 

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,208
Everybody used to say that I'm smart.

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,569
But here it is a daily struggle just to be heard.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,632
I know my English is not so good,

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,240
but that doesn't mean that 
my opinions and ideas matter less.

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
I wish they would just ask,

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
what do you mean, if they don't understand,

12
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
but they don't.

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
It's easier for them to ignore

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
to move on.

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Without me.

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,904
I have so much to contribute. 
If only they would make an effort to listen.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,144
Hey.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thanks for saying something. 
Sometimes it is easier for me to just ignore it.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,176
Thanks.
