1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,710
I mean, I don't know. 
It's like that's how it works, isn't it?

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,510
I mean. Aren't schools obligated 
to prioritize diverse candidates?

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,340
Well, you're making it sound like 
that I can show up and it is a done deal.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,480
Like all my hard work that I put in doesn't matter.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,470
I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,570
Can we move on please?

7
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,757
Look Michael,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,370
I'm...I'm...I'm really sorry. 
That...that's not how I meant it at all.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,060
Just forget about it.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,920
Okay?

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,500
Yeah, okay.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,420
Sorry.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,030
It's okay.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,870
Eat your food. Come on, girl.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,160
I didn't just magically get here because I am black.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm a straight A student.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,620
Top of my class.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,260
I know I belong here.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,610
This is what I tell myself everyday,

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,710
that I'm just as good as anybody else.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,100
that I earn my spot by working hard.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,350
When someone says something like that.

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,160
It makes you question yourself.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,970
Like, am I really good enough to be here?

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,140
Or did they have a open slot 
they had to fill with someone like me.

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,310
I wonder why she thought saying that...

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,970
would help.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,690
Thanks for trying.

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,020
I wouldn't say anything,

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,880
but she's actually a good friend.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,510
Anyway.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,230
Wish me luck?
