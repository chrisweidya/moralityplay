1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970
OK. What if you start with the negatives

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,660
and then move into positives?

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,230
Ah, sorry keep going.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey!

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,540
Maybe you can help.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,370
I need to find three negative and three positives

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,050
about myself for an interview.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,680
You are not helping.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,360
His master's interview is today.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,360
He's like super nervous.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,420
OK. Keep going.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,490
Finish your answer.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,960
I am passionat about my work.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,300
The program's goals fit my own.

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,480
And my background

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,240
offers a unique perspective.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,430
That's perfect.

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,830
Yes?

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:41,760
Yeah, that's perfect.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,060
OK, now.

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,020
Finish your lunch.We have other stuffs to do today.

22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,710
I think I have all his whole speech memorized right now.

23
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,900
You've been doing great helping me to rehearse.

24
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,840
This programe is my number one choice.

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,200
OK, relax. All right? You are shoe in.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,730
I mean the interview will go better if you relax.

27
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,630
But besides you have that extra advantage.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Why?

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,780
Because my great looks?

30
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,290
Ha Ha.

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,800
I mean you know 

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,570
universities put emphasis on diverse candidates.

33
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,840
What do you mean?

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,330
I mean being different from the majorities of the other candidats

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,730
will boost your chances.

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Off course. I mean you know I don't think that

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,340
gender or color should be a factor.

38
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,670
but sometimes it is.

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,650
I mean it can hold you back or it can push you forward.

40
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,650
So take advantage of it.

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,590
I would like to think they could at least think about

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,840
and, and, and listen to what I have to say.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
Well, yeah, they will.

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,340
I mean that't not what I meant.

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,270
I don't know.

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,930
Can we just move on, please?

47
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,630
OK. Come on. Come on. 

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,430
You know that's not what I meant.

49
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,250
Of course I think you can do it.

50
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,620
I just mean you can relax a little bit.

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,760
I mean. Come on.

52
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,700
You know I am just trying to help, right?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
