1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,437
Well, I just thought. I...

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,520
I..I mean I was born in the US,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,936
but my grandparents are from India, 
if that's what you meant.

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,067
I'm so sorry I didn't mean to sound...

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,056
Can we start over?
Sure.

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,975
Do you want to join our bake sale?

7
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,640
I'd love to.
Perfect.

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:24,443
My grandparents came from India. 
I was born here.

9
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,832
I remember the 4th of July fireworks.

10
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,456
My dad lifting me onto his shoulders 
so I can see better. 

11
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm proud of my heritage, 
but this is my home.

12
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:39,283
Once in a while someone thinks I don't fit 
the definition of how an American should look.

13
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:40,600
They ask..

14
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,300
but where are you really from?

15
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,105
Because you can't be from here.

16
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:48,838
America isn't just one race.
We all come from different places.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,817
I love telling my family story

18
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:55,504
Why can't they ask about that
instead of making me feel like..

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,528
I don't belong.

20
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,232
So what's it for by the way?

21
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm trying to raise money for a dance.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,584
Cool! When? Where?

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,400
Er..I don't think it's for you.

24
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:16,752
Trust me when I say you wouldn't like it.

25
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:19,056
Why? because I'm Indian?

26
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,744
What? No!

27
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:25,200
No. It's for the community center. 
They're organizing a dance for the senior citizens.

28
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:29,352
I don't think it's for us just yet. 
Not for like a long time anyway.

29
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,900
Yes, I get it. 
Well, I will still bake for that.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you so much!

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,100
I have to head to class.
See you later?

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,169
See you around.
