1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,437
Well, I just thought. I...

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,520
I..I mean I was born in the US,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,936
but my grandparents are from India, 
if that's what you meant.

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,067
I'm so sorry I didn't mean to sound...

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,056
Can we start over?
Sure.

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,975
Do you want to join our bake sale?

7
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,640
I'd love to.
Perfect.

8
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:24,443
My grandparents came from India. 
I was born here.

9
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,832
I remember the 4th of July fireworks.

10
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,456
My dad lifted me onto his shoulders, 
so I can see better. 

11
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm proud of my heritage, 
but this is my home.


12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,082
Once in awhile someone thinks I don't fit 
the definition of how an American should look.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,240
They ask..

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,850
But where are you really from?

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,105
Because you can't be from here.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,600
America isn't Just One race.
We all come from different places.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,300
I love telling my family story.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,950
Why can't they ask about that
instead of making me feel like..

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,528
I don't belong

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,760
So what's it for by the way

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm trying to raise money for a dance.

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,912
Cool! When? Where?

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Er..I don't think it's for you.

24
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:16,752
Trust me when I say you wouldn't like it.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,387
Why? because I'm Indian?

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,200
What? No!

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,895
No. It's at the community center. 
They're organizing a dance for the senior citizens.

28
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:28,790
I don't think it's for us just yet. 
Not for like a long time anyway.

29
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,275
Yes, I get it. 
Well, I will still bake for that.

30
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:32,620
Thank you so much!

31
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,272
I have to head to the class.
See you later?

32
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,350
See you around.
