1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
Okay, what if you start with the negatives
and then move into the positives?

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,070
Ah, sorry keep going.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,320
Hey!

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,720
Maybe you can help.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,140
I need to find three negatives and three positives 
about myself for an interview.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,560
You're not helping.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,240
His master's interview is today.
He's like super nervous.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,470
Okay. Keep going,
finish your answer.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,930
I'm passionate about my work,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,300
the program's goals fit my own,

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,240
and my background 
offers a unique perspective.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,830
That's perfect.
Yeah?

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,660
Yeah, that's perfect.

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,060
Okay, now,

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,020
finish your lunch.
We have other stuff to do today.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,710
I think I have his 
whole speech memorized right now.

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,900
You've been doing great 
helping me rehearse.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,840
This program is my number one choice.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,200
Okay, relax. Alright? 
You're a shoo-in.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,730
I mean the interview 
will go better if you relax.

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,630
Look, besides you have that extra advantage.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,780
Why, because of my great looks?

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,290
Haha...

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,570
I mean you know universities 
put emphasis on diverse candidates.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,840
What do you mean?

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,330
I mean being different from the majority 
of the other candidates

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,730
will boost your chances.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,340
Look, listen. I mean you know I don't think that 
gender or color should be a factor

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,670
but sometimes it is.

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,650
I mean it can hold you back 
or it can push you forward,

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,650
so take advantage of it.

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,590
I would like to think they could 
at least think about

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,840
an..and..and, and listen to what I have to say.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
Well yeah, they will.

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,340
That, I mean that's not what I meant.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,270
I don't know.

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,930
Can we just move on, please?

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,630
Okay. Come on, come on. 

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,430
You...you know that's not what I meant.

40
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,250
Of course I think you can do it.

41
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,520
I just mean you can relax a little bit.

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,760
I mean, come on.

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,430
I mean come on, you know I'm just
trying to help, right?
