1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
I mean where were you born.

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,500
I was born in the US.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,540
Oh, cool.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,728
Yeah, I'm going to be late to class.

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,288
Have a good day!
You too.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,360
I hate when people say that.

7
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,830
My grandparents came from India.
I was born here.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,040
I remember the 4th of July fireworks.

9
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:29,634
My dad lifting me onto his shoulders 
so I can see better.

10
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm proud of my heritage 
but this is my home.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,035
Once in a while someone thinks I don't fit 
the definition of how an American should look.

12
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:39,864
They ask..

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,650
but where are you really from?

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,546
Because you can't be from here.

15
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,264
America isn't just one race.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,312
We all come from different places.

17
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:51,563 
I love telling my family story.

18
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:54,712
Why can't they ask about that 
instead of making me feel like

19
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:55,736
I don't belong.
